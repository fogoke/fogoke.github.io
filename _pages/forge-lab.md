## About

The FORGE Lab develops machine learning methods for complex physical systems where data is expensive, physics matters, and real-time decisions are critical. Our research focuses on generative modeling, multi-modal sensor fusion, and physics-informed learning to enable AI-driven engineering design and manufacturing.

## Research Areas

- Generative models for simulation acceleration and data augmentation
- Multi-fidelity modeling and surrogate optimization
- Multi-modal sensor fusion for process monitoring
- Physics-informed machine learning
- Real-time prediction and control for cyber-physical systems
