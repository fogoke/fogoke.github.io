I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate within the MIT Mechanical Engineering Department, working with [Prof. Faez Ahmed](https://decode.mit.edu) and [Prof. John Hart](https://mechanosynthesis.mit.edu) in the intersection of machine learning, additive manufacturing, and design.


 I will join the Mechanical Engineering faculty at Carnegie Mellon University as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2025. I am broadly interested in developing artificial intelligence methods to enhance, understand, and control engineering processes.  My work focuses on creating physics-informed deep learning methods to accelerate simulation-based insights, designing probabilistic frameworks for analysis under uncertainty, and developing generalizable deep learning frameworks for interpreting information. These efforts aim to build foundational models for engineering problems, and are applicable to areas including advanced manufacturing, sensing, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins.


I completed my Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University in September 2024, where I was advised by [Prof. Amir Barati Farimani](https://baratilab.com). During my Ph.D., I developed deep learning methods to characterize, simulate, and control metal additive manufacturing processes. Prior to my Ph.D., I received a B.S.E in Chemical and Biological Engineering from Princeton University in 2019.

I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University in 2024 and my B.S.E. in Chemical and Biological Engineering from Princeton University in 2019. During my academic journey, I was honored to receive the Presidential Fellowship in the College of Engineering at Carnegie Mellon and the G.E.M. Fellowship. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology advised by Prof. Faez Ahmed and Prof. John Hart. -->
